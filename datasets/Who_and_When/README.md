# Who&When: #1 Benchmark for MAS **automated failure attribution.**

- **184** annotated failure tasks collected from
  - **Algorithm-generated agentic systems** built using [CaptainAgent](https://docs.ag2.ai/latest/docs/use-cases/notebooks/notebooks/agentchat_captainagent/),
  - **Hand-crafted systems** such as [Magnetic-One](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/).
- **Fine-grained annotations** for each failure, including:
  - The failure-responsible agent (who failed),
  - The decisive error step (when the critical error occurred),
  - A natural language explanation of the failure.

The dataset covers a wide range of realistic multi-agent scenarios based on queries from [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/gaia-benchmark) and [AssistantBench](https://assistantbench.github.io/). It serves as a foundational resource for developing and evaluating methods that aim to automatically pinpoint the causes of failures in complex agentic systems. We follow the following guide to annotate these failure logs. More information could be found in the paper.
